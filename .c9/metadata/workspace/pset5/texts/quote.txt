To truly, fully understand a time period, an event, a movement, or an important historical figure, you’d have to be there, and many times over.

Even then, you’d be lacking context. To really have the complete truth, you’d need background—the cultural nuances and national psyches of the time, the way each of the key players was raised during childhood and the subtle social dynamics between those players, the impact of what was going on in other parts of the world, and an equally-thorough understanding of the many past centuries that all of these things grew out of.","","That’s why not only can’t even the most perfect history buff fully understand history, but the key people involved at the time can’t ever know the full story.

Children identify with the good guys—the us guys—and they detest the bad guys—the them guys—and everyone’s happy.
